/// [#close()] itself, not `close()` racing a concurrent call to any *other* method. Nothing
/// synchronizes `close()` against a live call to, say, a `get`/`put` method on another thread —
/// one thread's [#ptr()] succeeding does not stop a second thread's `close()` from freeing that
/// same memory immediately afterward, before the native call that read `ptr()` actually runs.
/// Do not call `close()` on one thread while another thread might still be calling any method on
/// the same object; synchronize externally if your usage can't rule that out.
